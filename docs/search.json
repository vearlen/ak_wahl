    "text": "Author: Ilya Tishchenko\nThe Chamber of Labour1,2 (I’ll use sometimes later AK abbreviation for Arbeiterkammer) represents workers in Austria. It is quite a unique organisation without the analogs in other European countries3. In 2024 there is elections, various dates in various regions, in Tirol and Voralberg they are already over. And that is a rare occasion where I, as non-citizen, can vote, so I become curious.\nI’ve took and cleaned up the data and build a few graphs to answer the questions I have AK elections.

Just pause a bit and think - I bet you thought socialist. It’s socialist structure, supposed to protect workers. Yes, overall always socialists won the leadership in AK.
