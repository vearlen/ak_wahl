    "text": "Author: Ilya Tishchenko\nAustria has 26% of employee in trade union, this is 33rd place in the world, however there is organisation in Austria where all workers are members.\n\n\nThe Chamber of Labour (also known as AK, abbreviation for Arbeiterkammer) represents workers in Austria. It is quite a unique organisation without the analogs in other European countries, as written by Oberhuber et.al., 2014. In 2024 there is elections in AK, various dates in various regions, in Tirol and Voralberg they are already over. And that is a rare occasion where I, as non-citizen, can vote, so I become curious.\nI’ve took and cleaned up the data and build a few graphs to answer the questions I have AK elections. How in general is turnout? Below I compare it to turnout on parliament elections, the latter is quite impressive on it’s own.\nAs Oberhuber et. al., 2014 mention this kind of second order elections are in general has lower turnout.\n\nOne could see a significant drop in turnout in 1994, it has a lot to do with an increase of vote base by 31%1\nWithout digging into the graph who do you think most common winner for such a chamber? Just pause a bit and think - I bet you thought socialist. It’s socialist structure, supposed to protect workers. Yes, overall always socialists won the leadership in AK. Here comes my second question out of curiosity. How it correlates with parliament elections?\n\nAs could be seen only socialists (SPÖ2) has a gap downwards, result in parliament always lower than in AK elections. From last elections in 2019 the gap between results in AK (60%) and parliament (21%) is the biggest. For ÖVP the gap sometimes is really small and volatile, starting from 90s. FPÖ gap is growing lately with their increased popularity in parliament.\nThe open, rather ritorical question I have is if everybody elects socialist to protect himself as an employee why people vote for other during parliament elections?\n\nData available in repository github.com/vearlen/ak_whal\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nElectoral law reform from 1992 included unemployed, women on maternity leave and marginally employed people.↩︎\nI’ll call it SPÖ for simplicity, though in AK elections it’s FSG, same applies to other major parties ÖVP, FPÖ↩︎"
